# School Projects

This repository contains my solutions to some of the assignments of the courses I took during my undergraduate first and second year. These courses include Introduction to programming, OOP, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithm, Microprocessor and VHDL.

Algorithms implemented from scratch till date:

1. **[Students-Teachers Appointment System Class](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/School-Projects/tree/master/Appointment%20System)**: implemented with C++ (OOP Assignment).

2. **[Assembly Programming Project](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/School-Projects/tree/master/Assembly%20Language%20Project/Find%20Function%20Fast%20Calling%20Convention)**: implemented with Assembly Programming and C++.

3. **[Word Guesser](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/School-Projects/tree/master/Word%20Guesser-%20Linux%20and%20Windows)**: implemented with C++ (Algorithm assignment)

4. **[Boolean Function Minimizer using graphs](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/School-Projects/tree/master/Boolean%20Function%20Minimizer)**: implemented with Python (Discrete mathematics assignment).

5. **[VHDL Projects](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/School-Projects/tree/master/VHDL%20Projects)**: implementing combinational circuits and Washing Machine Controller using VHDL.

6. **[Tournament](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/School-Projects/tree/master/Tournament)**: implementing with C (Inroduction to Programming assignment).
